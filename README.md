Some fun with the Colatz Conjecture

## Collatz Conjecture
The Collatz Conjecture is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics. It proposes that for any positive integer n, the following iterative process will always reach the number 1:

- If n is even, divide it by 2 to get n/2.
- If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to get 3n + 1.  

For example, starting with n = 6, the sequence is: 6 → 3 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1.

This program takes a positive integer n as input, and returns the number of steps it takes to reach 1 using the Collatz Conjecture, as well as the maximum value encountered during the process.
